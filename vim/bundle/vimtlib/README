This repository used to include several plugins many of which were moved to git repositories of their own -- please see https://github.com/tomtom for a list of plugins. The remaining parts of vimtlib include vim-related ruby-scripts, vimball recipes and other support files related to the vim plugins listed in "plugins.txt".


* Install

For VIM plugins see INSTALL.TXT.

For vimdedoc.rb: Make sure the ruby script is executeable and put it (or an alias) into a directory that is included in ''$PATH''. On windows, I suggest to create a batch script that includes the line ''ruby.exe %DIRECTORY%\\vimtlib\\ruby\\vimdedoc.rb %*''.

Skeletons: The skeletons have to be copied into ~/.vim/skeletons/... or ~/vimfiles/skeletons/...

Vimball recipes: You can use VIM's ''MkVimball'' command or the ruby-based vimball.rb (https://github.com/tomtom/vimball.rb) to create vimballs from those recipes.


* Scripts

    install_plugin.sh    ... A shell script to copy files to a master .vim directory
    ruby/vimdedoc.rb     ... The ill-conceived, casual vimscript source code documenter
